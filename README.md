## Features

- 🎯 Simple, interactive web interface
- 📊 Predicts marks using a trained linear regression model
- 📝 Accepts multiple student features as input
- 🚀 Fast, real-time predictions

## How It Works

The app uses a regression model trained on the `StudentsPerformance.csv` dataset. The model considers features like gender, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, math score, and reading score to predict the final marks.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in education by providing a simple, accessible tool for predicting student marks. By leveraging real-world data and a user-friendly interface, it empowers users to make data-driven decisions and gain insights into student performance. The approach can be extended or improved with more features, advanced models, or integration into larger educational platforms.
